JavaScript-Code-Academy
=======================

This repository contains my take on the various major exercises from the [JavaScript class] (http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) at [Code Academy] (http://www.codecademy.com/).

Also, fiddles exist on JSFiddle:

* [Coin Flipper](http://jsfiddle.net/ptdecker/NG64G/)
* [Fibonacci Numbers] (http://jsfiddle.net/ptdecker/kCKFc/)
* [String Search] (http://jsfiddle.net/ptdecker/ShpqW/)
* [Rock, Paper, Scissors] (http://jsfiddle.net/ptdecker/9Mnz3/)

Note: These exercises are written so that they will pass the exercise check in Code Academy. In some cases, I would implement them differently but in a way that wouldn't pass the Code Academy check. Where applicable, I've noted these in the comments.

Any and all feedback is welcome.
