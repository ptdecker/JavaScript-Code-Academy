JavaScript-Code-Academy
=======================

See [JavaScript-Code-Academy wiki] (https://github.com/ptdecker/JavaScript-Code-Academy/wiki) for the most current information.

This repository contains my take on the various major exercises from the [JavaScript class] (http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) at [Code Academy] (http://www.codecademy.com/).

Also, fiddles exist on [my JSFiddle account] (http://jsfiddle.net/user/ptdecker/fiddles/). And, sources in the repository contain comments explaining changes needed to support execution on JSFiddle. Fiddles were provided so that non-Code Adacemy developers can run these excercises. At this point, the code used to emulate the console in JSFiddle (c.f. http://www.wkoorts.com/wkblog/2013/01/26/console-log-with-jsfiddle/) does not display arrays as cleanly as Code Academy. Hopefully, I'll address this in the future.

Fiddle list:

* [Coin Flipper] (http://jsfiddle.net/ptdecker/NG64G/)
* [Fibonacci Numbers] (http://jsfiddle.net/ptdecker/kCKFc/)
* [String Search] (http://jsfiddle.net/ptdecker/ShpqW/)
* [Rock, Paper, Scissors] (http://jsfiddle.net/ptdecker/9Mnz3/)

These exercises are written so that they will pass the exercise check in Code Academy. In some cases, I would implement them differently but in a way that wouldn't pass the Code Academy check. Where applicable, I've noted these in the comments.

Any and all feedback is welcome.
